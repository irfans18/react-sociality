# Commit Message Conventions

## Statement

Commit messages must be structured, meaningful, and machine-readable for audit and CI/CD automation.

## Format (Conventional Commits Standard)

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

### Required Structure
- **Type**: One of the defined types (see below)
- **Scope**: Optional but recommended - module/component/area affected (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `auth`, `facilities`, `claims`)
- **Summary**: Brief, imperative-mood description (max 72 characters recommended)

## Types Defined

- **feat** – New feature
- **fix** – Bug fix
- **docs** – Documentation only
- **style** – Code style/formatting (no logic change)
- **refactor** – Code restructure
- **test** – Adding or updating tests
- **ci** – Changes related to CI/CD pipeline

## Examples

### Basic Format
```
feat(api): add endpoint for DRG version listing
fix(ui): correct ICD dropdown alignment
ci(pipeline): add Snyk vulnerability scan step
```

### With Scope Examples
```
feat(facilities): implement facility search filter
fix(claims): resolve tariff calculation error
refactor(auth): simplify token refresh logic
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(theme): adjust button padding spacing
test(api): add unit tests for DRG endpoints
```

## Commit Body (Optional)

Used for detailed context, ticket references, or compliance notes.

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<detailed explanation>
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Reference to ticket/issue if applicable
```

### Example
```
fix(api): correct tariff calculation formula

- Adjusted cost-weight multiplier logic
- Aligned with ISO 10781 §RI.1.1.25 validation rules
- Resolves issue #1234
```

## Scope Guidelines

Common scopes in this project:
- `api` - API endpoints, data fetching
- `ui` - User interface components
- `auth` - Authentication and authorization
- `facilities` - Facilities module
- `claims` - Claims module
- `theme` - Styling and theming
- `routing` - Route configuration
- `hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `pipeline` - CI/CD configuration

## Rules

1. **Always use imperative mood** in the summary (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds")
2. **Keep summary under 72 characters** when possible
3. **Use lowercase** for type and scope
4. **Scope is optional** but highly recommended for better organization
5. **Body is optional** but should be used for complex changes or when context is needed
6. **Reference tickets/issues** in the body when applicable

## Enforcement

All commit messages generated by Cursor must follow this convention. Non-compliant commit messages will be rejected. Never do auto-commit on every chat
